    <p>Beef brisket is one of the most flavorful cuts of meat, although it is tough and needs to be cooked in just the right way. It's also a moderately fatty cut of beef, but this can work to your advantage because it tenderizes into succulent, meaty perfection.</p>
    <p>Taken from the area around the breastbone, the brisket is basically the chest or pectoral muscle of the animal. The characteristically thick, coarse-grained meat needs a lot of time and low-temperature cooking to break down and tenderize. </p>
    <p>Brisket is frequently used for making pot roast, and it's the traditional choice for corned beef. Another very popular technique for preparing brisket is to slow cook it in a barbecue or smoker. </p>

    <h3>Tip</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Typically after 8 to 10 hours, a piece of meat will have absorbed as much smoke as it can, and additional smoking may impart a bitter flavor.</li>
        <li>Check the internal temperature of the meat with an instant-read thermometer.</li>
        <li>There are many ways to enjoy leftover brisket, from scrumptious sandwiches and salads to chilis and pies.</li>
